The image given has two pieces of metadata:

```
the_first_pass_is_short: And hides the keeper
the_second_is_rotten: aopyallu_pz_ihk_sbjr
```

The metadata hints that there's two passwords, one short, and one that is given, with the characters rotated by 7 positions.

The image itself shows the icon of the KeepassXC utility, a password manager.

Intuitively, the hacker should realize that there's a keepass database hidden in the image, protected using a short password. This hints to using steghide to extract it. So the hacker is expected to crack the short password using a script to automatically try short passwords. The password is "long".

Once the hacker has extracted the keepass database, they have the second password (once it is rotated back) that they can use to unlock it. The rotated password is: "thirteen_is_bad_luck"

Inside the database are a variety of 'key' entries. Each entry has a title and a password. The entry holding the flag is in the recycle bin. The current password for the entry is not the actual flag; the hacker is meant to notice that previous versions of the password exist, one of which holds the real flag.

Flag: CCSC{history_may_not_repeat_or_rhyme_but_it_is_always_useful}
